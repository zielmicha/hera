More documentation on its way.

## Running Hera on your own cluster

### External dependencies

* python-3.4
* debootstrap
* supervisor
* eatmydata
* openvpn
* qemu-system-x86_64
* npm
* build-essential
* git
* bridge-utils

You should install relatively new `pip`, `virtualenv` and `requests`. There seems to be a bug in `urllib3` shipped in e.g. Debian 8, which prevents `virtualenv` from creating the environment.

```
pip3 install --upgrade pip virtualenv requests
```

### Development

Install:

* bundler

Your `/etc/hosts` should contain entries for the Hera development server:

```
127.0.0.1	localhost api.hera.dev hera.dev www.hera.dev proxy.hera.dev
```

Setup database

```
echo 'DEBUG = True' > local_settings.py
(. venv/bin/activate && ./manage.py syncdb && ./manage.py migrate)
```

Run all componenets:

```
make run_all
```

Hera claims port 80 even during development. If you are really sad about it, run Hera in network namespace.

### Interhost communication

(X connects to Y)

* spawner -> dispatcher (VM creation, port 10001)
* REST -> dispatcher (VM creation, port 10002, HTTP)
* REST -> vmcontroller (commands, random port, socket)
* agent -> stream proxy (HTTP)

All modules also require shared directory (e.g. mounted via NFS) `IMAGE_STORE` and a database connection.
